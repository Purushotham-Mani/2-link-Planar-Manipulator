# 2-Link Planar Manipulator
This project is part of my initial research work, focused on simulating a two-link planar manipulator. The ultimate goal is to implement a PD controller with gravity compensation to compute the torque required for the manipulator to follow a predefined trajectory.

## Key Components of the Project:
1) Free Fall Simulation: Simulates the natural motion of the manipulator under gravity.
2) Predefined Trajectory Tracking: Calculates the torque necessary for the manipulator to follow a specified path using a PD controller with gravity compensation.
