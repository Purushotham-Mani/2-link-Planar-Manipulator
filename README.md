# 2-link-Planar-Manipulator
This was the first entry task in my research project. The task aims to solve and model a Two-link Planar manipulator. End goal is to implement a PD-Controller and Calculate torque required for the Manipulator to follow a pre-defined trajetory.

This project contains: 1) Free Fall of the Manipulator 2)Predefined Trajectory
